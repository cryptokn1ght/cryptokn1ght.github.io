            <p> Click <a href="mailto:gavin.williamson.mp@parliament.uk?&bcc=gavin@gavinwilliamson.org&bcc=james.daly.mp@parliament.uk&bcc=the.mayor@greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk&subject=Justice%20For%20Shukri%20Abdi&body=Dear All,%0D%0A%0D%0AI hope you are well. My name is [NAME] and I live in [CITY].%0D%0A%0D%0AI am shocked and appalled that I have not heard you speak about the tragic death of Shukri Abdi. A twelve year old Somali refugee, who drowned in the River Irwell in Bury on 27th June 2019.%0D%0A%0D%0AI gather from the news that the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) have described this as a ‘tragic the accident’. However, it was reported that during the coroner’s hearing one of the children that accompanied Shukri to the river admitted saying to Shukri, ‘if you don’t get into the water, I’m going to kill you.’ Shukri’s mother, Zamzam Ture has said she had no idea why her daughter was in the water as she could not swim. This begs the question as to whether or not it was an accident?%0D%0A%0D%0AI urge you to immediately conduct an independent inquiry into both the Local Education Authority of Bury, Lancashire and also Broad Oak Sports College (now Hazel Wood High School) for their potential negligence and violation of their duty of care towards Shukri in light of accusations of failure to address multiple incidents of bullying. Furthermore, I call for James Frith (former Labour MP for Bury North) and Tamoor Tariq (First Deputy Leader of the Council Cabinet Member for Children, Schools and Families) to be to investigated for their failure and neglect in addressing and tackling continual issues relating to Broad Oak Sports College prior to and during the period of time relating to Shukri’s death.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe family had already raised multiple concerns with the school, Broad Oak sports college in Bury, that Shukri had been bullied for more than a year and feel that their concerns were not taken seriously or solemnly. Following her death, there was a meeting at the police station with the school but an interpreter was not provided, rendering the meeting futile. This does not speak well of either the school or the police’s attitude towards the family. The IOPC are investigating the Manchester police’s treatment of this case.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is highly likely that racism, Islamophobia and bullying are linked in this case. I believe that the school’s role needs a scrupulous investigation to ensure that they have not been negligent in their care of duty towards Shurki. By the same token, the police’s role should also be investigated as they may have failed to handle the case with the sensitivity and empathy that should automatically be expected.%0D%0A%0D%0AIn addition, I request that you review every school's guidelines and policy in regards to anti-bullying. Extra special consideration and attention must taken by all schools when receiving complaints of bullying and harassment from vulnerable families especially those from refugee backgrounds. Translators must be provided to attend all meetings between members of staff and parents and all records of complaints must be made readily available upon request. I believe Shukri Abdi and her family were failed by the school repeatedly and this injustice must never happen again.%0D%0A%0D%0AIt is vitally crucial that those who come to this country for a better life be treated as the law requires in a fair manner to support their integration into our society. I have been extremely disturbed by the various reports in the press and would ask you to consider a more thorough investigation into the school’s handling of this case.%0D%0A%0D%0ACan I expect to hear you speak out on this matter urgently? I am anticipating a detailed response to these concerns I have raised with you.%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely,%0D%0A[YOUR NAME]" target="_blank"> HERE </a> to email UK Parliament Members to demand justice for Shukri Abdi. </p>
