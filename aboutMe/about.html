  	  		<h1> About Me </h1>
          <p style="color: grey;"> <img src="images/locationPin.svg" style="height: 20px;"> New York, NY </p>
  	  		<p> I was born in Busan, Korea, but I moved to the US when I was 3 years old. I lived in Guam and Oakland for a while before moving to Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 6. There, I discovered my interest in engineering and designing. While at NYU, I found my motivation for why I wanted to continue being an engineer - I want to improve the quality of everyday life for those who are less fortunate and make everyday life easier for those whose lives are difficult. I learned how to use SolidWorks as a first-year, and throughout my four years at NYU, I fell in love with the design and prototyping process; I loved working in teams and creating something from conceptualization. As an engineer, it's my goal to improve quality of life, whether that's cleaning the oceans, building solar powered homes, or creating a life-saving technology. I wish to help those around me through innovation and creative design. </p>
          <p> I recently graduated from New York University Tandon School of Engineering with a BS in Mecanical Engineering as a first-generation student with a GPA of 3.27/4.00. Some of my accomplishments include: Dean's List (Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020), Dr. Morris Young Outstanding Design Project Award (2020), and Division of Libraries Dean's Award (2019). </p>
          <p> Outside of classes, I try to improve my skills and learn new ones as well. I enjoy 3D modeling in SolidWorks and trying to recreate models from previouse SolidWorks Model Mania Competitions. Last summer, I experimented with KeyShot to create high quality renderings for my portfolio. I taught myself in a week and created some beautiful high quality renderings of SolidWorks models I had worked on. Currently, I am learning web development (HTML, CSS); while I learned the basics, I am trying to expand my knowledge by learning JavaScript and different libraries. </p>
          <h1> My Experience </h1>
          <h2> WOOMBA (Fall 2019 - Spring 2020) | Dr. Morris Young Outstanding Design Project Award </h2>
          <p> WOOMBA is an aquatic partial submersion remotely operated vehicle (ROV) tasked with removing surface trash/pollutants from still bodies of water. With a budget of $1500, I worked with a team of 5 other Mechanical Engineering students to conceptualize and design the WOOMBA. I worked on the framework of the WOOMBA and prototyped parts and assemblies in SolidWorks. Over a 6 month period, I produced over 5 different iterations while working with my team members to create an optimal design. Working with weight (handling and transport), size (manufacturing restrictions), and price constraints (effect on design based on material strength/properties), I modeled a complete assembly of the WOOMBA with designed parts, multiple sub-assemblies, and technical drawings. </p>
          <h2> The Parking Lot Project - Ultrasonic Sensor Housing Units (Fall 2018 - Spring 2020) </h2>
          <p> The Parking Lot Project was proposed by a group of student workers who worked as part of the Dibner Library IT Staff. The purpose of the project is to help students find open study spaces at the library quickly before even entering the building. The system is a live human detection system that utilizes Ultrasonic Range Sensors to detect whether a seat is occupied or empty. The results update in real-time and is displayed on a UI available to students connected to an NYU network. I worked with software and hardware engineers to design housing units for the sensors, Raspberry Pi's, and circuit boards. I iteratively designed over 6 different cases in SolidWorks and utilized the NYU MakerSpace to 3D print and test fit, installtion, ease of installation, ease of maintenance, and tampering. The Parking Lot Project is currently live, and over 500 housing units for hardware are actively in deployment. </p>
          <h2> MakerBot Industries - Materials & Test Engineering Intern (Fall 2019) </h2>
          <p> I worked at MakerBot as a part-time intern on the Test Engineering Team. I helped maintain a testing jig (UTJ) - a broken down MakerBot Printer with extra sensors and a data acquisition system - and helped to improve a LabVIEW program to automate testing. Using the UTJ, I tested over 20 different plastics, acquired testing data, and processed data into visual graphs using R. Throughout the internship, I developed a portfolio of material testing data that other Test Engineers used to tune foreign materials in Method/MethodX printers. The testing team operated like a startup, and the work environment was very fast-paced and teamwork based. This forced me to learn processes and skills very quickly, as being adaptable was a key trait in being successful. </p>
          <h2> Advanced CAD Design Project - R2D2 (Fall 2019) </h2>
          <p> As my final project for my Advanced CAD Class, my partner and I decided to do a rebranding of R2D2 for Disney Parks. We proposed a full-scale model of R2D2 and a sith configuration that could be manufactured and deployed at Disney Parks. As a team, we worked to model a full prototype of the parts and assembly in SolidWorks, ran simulations of static structural loading on components, created technical drawings (Bill of Materials, Sales Drawing, Parts Drawings, and a high quality product mock-up rendering). This project was a mock design contract project meant to replicate the process of developing a design package for a client, which in this case was Disney. </p>
          <h2> The Apollo Project - The Hubble Telescope (Fall 2019 - Spring 2020) </h2>
          <p> The Apollo Project is an electro-mechanical display at NYU Dibner Library dedicated to the moon landing mission. The system is designed from the bottom up, with 3D printed parts, built from scratch. The Hubble Telescope was a part of the project I worked on, where I designed a simplified version of the Hubble Telescope in SolidWorks and 3D printed the parts to assemble. The telescope features a mechanical hinge door that is moved using a servo motor, controlled using a programmed arduino. </p>
          <h2> NYU SAE Aero (Fall 2018 - Spring 2019) </h2>
          <p> The Society of Automative Engineers Aero Design competition is held every year and requires students to design and build an aircraft from scratch while meeting specific mission and design criteria. I worked with a team of 4 other students to create a fully operable, electric powered, 12 ft wingspan aircraft with two secondary autonomous gliders. I designed the wings and tail of the aircraft using SolidWorks; throughout the design process, I researched optimal airfoils, tail configurations, manufacturing options, and wing planforms. I worked to continously improve the designs by adding a mechanism to allow the tail/empennage to be removed for easier transport, and decreased the moment from the tail to increase stability of the aircraft. Our aircraft was test flown 3 different times, and was unsuccessful in flight all 3 times due to inclement weather. However, between each test flight, we redesigned and rebuilt the aircraft to improve the structural strength. Although we were unable to compete, the skills and takeaways from the project were much more valuable than competing. </p>
          <h2> NYU RePrint Bot (Fall 2018 - Winter 2018) </h2>
          <p> RePrint Bot is a standalone system meant to shred plastic water bottles and extrude the plastic into 3D printing filament. I worked on the extruder and shredder sub-assembly and created prototypes in SolidWorks. Using existing parts, I created new parts such as hopper, a more stable extruder stand, and a ball-bearing system using parts of McMaster Carr. The project was temporarily discontinued due to budget cuts but was recently continued and taken in a slightly different direction. </p>
          <h2> 3D Printed Robotic Crane Arm (Spring 2017) </h2>
          <p> This was my first project in SolidWorks. I was given a picture of a robotic arm and the objective was to recreate the robotic arm in SolidWorks with my own dimensions and 3D print the parts. I started by creating sketches using a ruler to visualize proportions. The arm is fully mechanical with functioning joints and moving parts. </p>
